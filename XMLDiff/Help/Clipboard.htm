        <p>
            Cut/Copy/Paste and Drag/drop are based on the same XML clipboard format.  For example, you can
            drag a node out of Microsoft XML Notepad and into any editor that supports a text clipboard format and its
            the same as doing a Cut & Paste operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clipboard format is the XML serialization of the selected node plus any namespace declarations
            needed to make that fragment well formed.
        </p>
        <p>
            When XML is pasted from the clipboard (or dropped) onto the tree view the namespace declarations
            are matched with what is in the target document already and normalized accordingly.  This ensures
            your document doesn't sprout lots of redundant namespace declarations as a side effect of these
            editing operations.
